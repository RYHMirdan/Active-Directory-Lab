# Active-Directory-Lab

Using this Lab that Ive set up, Ive imitated a mini corporate Active Directory environment that utlizes Windows Server and supporting services.
Built in VMware workstaion, this lab includes a Windows Server which is setup to be the domain controller and a Windows 10 server which acts as Client 1. Active Directory, DNS, DHCP services, and RAS for NAT were all also installed and configured, aswell as Powershell scripting for automation.

+ **Windows Server 2019:** Domain Controller
+ **Windows 10:** Client user
+ **Active Directory Users & Computers:** Users and Admin group management
+ **Powershell:** Script automated bulk 1000 users creation

**Practical Experience:**

+ **Identity and Access Management (IAM) with AD**
+ **DNS troubleshooring: forward/reverse lookups, ping testing**
